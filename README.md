# 🛰️ Satellite Image Captioning

This project detects objects in high-resolution satellite images and generates short captions using advanced deep learning models like BLIP-2. It also provides a Q&A feature for the cropped region.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Cropping of satellite image regions
- ✅ Caption generation using BLIP-2
- ✅ Question & Answer on the cropped image
- ✅ Interface built with HTML, JavaScript

## 📁 Dataset Used

- RSICD (Remote Sensing Image Captioning Dataset)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- BLIP-2 for captioning
- Gradio (or JavaScript) for user interface

## 📷 How it Works

1. Upload a satellite image
2. Select and crop any region
3. Generate a short caption for the selected region
4. Ask questions related to the region (e.g., "What is seen in this area?")
5. Generates a detailed caption about the cropped image
